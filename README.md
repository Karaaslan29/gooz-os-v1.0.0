# Gooz Project for ESP32
The Gooz project acts as an operating system and aims at a Linux experience for microcontrollers. It includes many features such as general microcontroller usage, package management system and IoT based operations.

# Basics
Basic GOOZ commands to use operating system like Linux

### list Command

```bash
>>> list
```

- Lists available functions that user can use.

### help Command

```bash
>>> help
---OUTPUT---
ls
pwd
cd
rm
rmdir
cat
clear
echo
touch
mkdir
mv
cp
list
INFO:For more information about commands -> help [COMMAND]
```

- Shows some fundamental commands that can be used by user as seen in the example.
    
    ```bash
    >>> help pwd
    ---OUTPUT---
    INFO:Usage -> pwd
    INFO:prints the current working directory
    ```
    
    - Helps about a specific command as seen in the example.

### history Command

```bash
>>> history 
```

- Shows past commands used by user.

### clear Command

```bash
>>> clear
```

- Clears the terminal screen.

### delay Command

```bash
delay [TIME]
```

- Delays all programs as much as `[TIME]` seconds.

### reset Command

```bash
>>> reset
```

- Resets the system.

### shutdown Command

```bash
>>> shutdown
```

- Shuts the system.

# System Configuration

System default settings and configurations of GoozOS.

## Show Configs

```bash
conf show #Show all configs of GoozOS
conf show [CONFIG_PATH] #Show the config value in given [CONFIG_PATH]

conf show system
>>>{'machine': 'ESP32', 'version': '0.0.1'}

conf show system/machine
>>> ESP32
```

- `[CONFIG_PATH]` can refer to a single configuration or multiple configurations
- Configurations format is JSON

## Changing Configurations

```bash
>>> conf change [CONFIG_PATH] [NEW_VALUE] 
# Change the value of the variable at [CONFIG_PATH] as [NEW_VALUE]

>>> conf change user/password 1234
The value which refers to "user/password" successfully changed as "1234"
```

- Changing configurations does not support multiple changes. That means the `[CONFIG_PATH]` must refer to a single configuration.
- System configuration does not support adding new configuration. If you need new key-value type data you can use Environment Variables.

# Environment Variables

Environment variables of GoozOS

## Environent Variable Format

- Variables are stored in etc/env/env_variables.txt
- Environment variables have fallowing format in etc/env/env_variables.txt

<aside>
üìé exampleKey=example variable value
message=Hello Gooz!
defGpio=pin var gpio --name myPin --pin 2 --type OUT
pinConfig=--name myPin --pin 2 --type OUT

</aside>

- Variable key must be one word, it can not contain special characters such as ‚Äò=‚Äô but it can contain ‚Äò_‚Äô character.
- Variable value supports multiple word and special characters except ‚Äò=‚Äô and python default escape characters

## What is Environment Variable

- Environment variable can store value and can be called anywhere in the system.
- If GoozEngine sees `$[VARIABLE_KEY]` in any command it will change it to `[VARIABLE_KEY]`

## Variable Monitoring

```bash
>>> env # Show all saved environment variables
>>> env [VARIABLE_KEY] # Show environment variable named [VARIABLE_KEY]
```

- Also, `echo` command can be used to print any variable value

```bash
>>> echo $[VARIABLE_KEY] # Show environment variable named [VARIABLE_KEY]
```

- `echo` command prints everything written after it. It supports environment variables too.

## Adding and Changing Variables

```bash
>>> export [VARIABLE_KEY]=[VARIABLE_VALUE]

>>> export message=Hello Gooz! 
#It will add environment variable in etc/env/env_variables.txt
```

The following way can also be used for adding or changing variable

```bash
>>> $[VARIABLE_KEY] = [VARIABLE_VALUE]

>>> $message = Hello Gooz!
#It will add environment variable in etc/env/env_variables.txt
```

- If the key named `[VARIABLE_KEY]` already exist, the value is changed to `[VARIABLE_VALUE]`
- If there is no key named `[VARIABLE_KEY]`, the value named `[VARIABLE_VALUE]` will be created.

## Variable Removing

```bash
>>> unset [VARIABLE_KEY] # Delete the variable named [VARIABLE_KEY]

>>> unset message # Delete the variable named 'message'
```

## Example Usage

```bash
>>> export pinConfig=--name myPin --pin 2 --type OUT
---OUTPUT---
INFO:The variable added successfully: pinConfig=--name myPin --pin 2 --type OUT

>>> env pinConfig
---OUTPUT---
--name myPin --pin 2 --type OUT

>>> pin var gpio $pinConfig

INFO:The var pin named new successfully registered
---OUTPUT---
{'--pin': '2', '--type': 'OUT', 'pinType': 'gpio', '--name': 'myPin'}

>>> pin gpio write myPin 1 
```

```

## SPI Pin Usage

---

### Sending Data from SPI Pin

```bash
>>> pin spi write [PIN_NAME] --data [TX_DATA] 
# Sends [TX_DATA] to spi pin named [PIN_NAME]

>>> pin spi write myPin --data Hi
>>> pin spi write myPin --data "Hello World!"
```

- [TX_DATA] have to be in double quotes if it is more than one word.

### Reading Data from SPI Pin

```bash
>>> pin spi read [PIN_NAME] --byte [BYTE_SIZE] # reads datas in length of [BYTE_SIZE] from spi pin named [PIN_NAME]
>>> pin spi read myPin --byte 10
```

### Reading Data Continuously from I2C Pin

```bash
>>> pin spi  listen [PIN_NAME]  # Takes data from [PIN_NAME] continuously in thread
>>> pin spi listen myPin

>>> pin spi listen stop  # stops reading message from all spi pins
```

### Reading Data Continuously from I2C Pin

- Listen command supports many reads from given spi pin.
- Listen command will create a listen thread operation.
    - For stopping, showing current operations and more information please visit thread page

```bash
>>> pin spi listen [PIN_NAME] # Reads value from spi pin named [PIN_NAME] every 1 second
>>> pin spi listen myPin
```

- Listen command accepts some parameters
    
    ```bash
    >>> pin spi listen [PIN_NAME] --[PARAMETER_KEY] [PARAMETER_VALUE] 
    ```
    
    - Parameters:
        - --file [FILE_NAME]
            - If this parameter exists, the readed value will be written in the given `[FILE_NAME]`
            - `[FILE_NAME]` format can be directly file name or file name with path
                - listen_values.txt
                - /user_files/listen_values.txt
        - --date [DATE_BOOL]
            - Default value of `[DATE_BOOL]` is `1`
            - `[DATE_BOOL]` can be 1 or 0
            - If `[DATE_BOOL]` 1, the readed value will be written with date
        - --loop [LOOP_COUNT]
            - Default value of `[LOOP_COUNT]` is `-1` that means, it will read until stopped manually.
            - If `[LOOP_COUNT]` is bigger than 0, the number of reads will be the given number.
        - --delay [SLEEP_TIME]
            - Default value of `[SLEEP_TIME]` is `1`
            - `[SLEEP_TIME]` can be any float number.
            - Listen command waits as `[SLEEP_TIME]` (unit = second) between two read operations.
        - --end [END_CHARACTER]
            - Default value of `[END_CHARACTER]` is `‚Äú\n‚Äù`
            - `[END_CHARACTER]` can be any character
            - Listen command prints given `[END_CHARACTER]` after readed value in files.
        
        ### Example Usage of Listen Command
        
        ```bash
        	>>> pin spi listen myPin --file values.txt --delay 0.5
        ```
        
        - Every `0.5` second the readed value of `myPin` is written to file named `values.txt`

# Thread

- Thread supports multiple operations in same time.
- Thread tool can be used for running micropython scripts.
- Also, `pin listen` commands are a thread operation.

## Thread Usage

### Thread Show

```bash
>>> thread show # Shows current thread operations and settings
--OUTPUT--
{'ID': 1, '--delay': '0', 'code_file_name': 'blink.py', 'type': 'code'}
```

### Thread Start

```bash
>>> thread start [FILE_NAME] # Run file named [FILE_NAME] in thread
```

- `thread start` command also accepts some parameters
    - Parameters:
        - --delay [SLEEP_TIME]
            - Default value of `[SLEEP_TIME]` is `1`
            - `[SLEEP_TIME]` is can be any float number.
            - `thread start` command waits as `[SLEEP_TIME]` (unit = second) between two run operations.
        - --loop [LOOP_COUNT]
            - Default value of `[LOOP_COUNT]` is `-1` that means, it will run file until stopped manually.
            - If `[LOOP_COUNT]` is bigger than 0, the number of runs will be the given number.

### Thread Stop

```bash
>>> thread stop [THREAD_ID] # Stops thread operation by ID
```

## Thread File Format

- The same named variables in different thread operations causes errors!
    - But, same named functions does not cause errors

## Example Thread Usage

- ledblink.py

```python
def blink():
    from machine import Pin
    import utime
    led = Pin(2,Pin.OUT)
    led.value(1)
    utime.sleep(1)
    led.value(0)
    utime.sleep(1)   
blink()
```

- Imports must be in function

```bash
>>> thread start ledblink.py --delay 0
```

```bash
>>> thread show
---OUTPUT---
{'ID': 1, '--delay': '0',  'code_file_name': 'ledblink.py', 'type': 'code', '--loop':'-1'}
```

```bash
>>> thread stop 1
```

# Package Installer

## Package Install

```bash
pkg install [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

## Package Uninstall

```bash
pkg uninstall [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

## Package Installer Templates

For JSON file

```json
{
    "name" : "tester",
    "codes" : [{"filename":"main.py","code":"def run():\\n    print('Hello from tester')"}],
    "managersnip":"    elif cmd_arr[0] == 'tester':\\n        try:\\n            import app.tester.main\\n            app.tester.main.run()\\n        except:\\n            print('This app is deleted')\\n"
}
```

There are 3 fields for packaging. These are `name`, `codes` and `managersnip` 

Name field includes package name and this name also exists in .json file as a name

Codes field include `.py` files and their codes. Every code have to be written as string format. This format must be same Thonny IDE code styling. So `\t` does not be used.

Gooz Package Installer seperates these files and their codes, after it creates a application folder under `app` folder. The file which is `[pkgmanager.py](http://pkgmanager.py)` manages application orchestration. So, `pkgmanager` must include runner codes. It is provided with managersnip field in JSON file. Managersnip codes have to be like example JSON file.

For new line `\\n` must be used

Every application has any folder when turning on package, because every application contains only `.py` files. Unlimited py files can be used but not contain any folder.
